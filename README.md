## Introduction

I’m a Design and User Experience specialist who crafts words, graphics, and information into beautiful, accessible, and effective outcomes.

My contributions often appear in websites and digital products, yet I’m no stranger to physical and time-based media.

I’ve got a thing for solving tricky problems and am at my best when spanning multiple disciplines to achieve holistically integrated outcomes.

I live in Hobart, Tasmania, and am a citizen of both Australia and the United States.
